```

## Installation

### Git

git clone https://github.com/mihaeu/php-test-generator
cd php-test-generator

## Example

Given a PHP file like:

```php
<?php // A.php

class A {
    public function __construct(ClassA $classA) {}
}
```

Running `test-generator A.php` will produce a test including mocked dependencies:

```php
<?php declare(strict_types = 1);

use PHPUnit\Framework\TestCase;

class ATest extends TestCase
{
    /** @var A */
    private $a;

    /** @var ClassA | PHPUnit_Framework_MockObject_MockObject */
    private $classA;

    protected function setUp()
    {
        $this->classA = $this->createMock(ClassA::class);
        $this->a = new A(
            $this->classA
        );
    }

    public function testMissing()
    {
        $this->fail('Test not yet implemented');
    }
}
```
