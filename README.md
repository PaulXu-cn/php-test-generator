> Generate test cases for existing files

## Usage

```bash
bin/test-generator --help
```

```
Test-Generator

Usage:
  test-generator <file> [--php5] [--phpunit5] [--mockery] [--covers]

Options:
  --php5        Generate PHP5 compatible code [default:false].
  --phpunit5    Generate a test for PHPUnit 5 [default:false].
  --mockery     Generates mocks using Mockery [default:false].
  --covers      Adds the @covers annotation   [default:false].
```

## Installation

### Composer (PHP 7.1+)

```bash
# local install
composer require "mihaeu/test-generator:^1.0"

# global install
composer global require "mihaeu/test-generator:^1.0"
```

### Phar (PHP 5.5+)

Since I actually need to use this on 5.5 legacy projects (should work with 5.4 as well, but didn't test for it), I also release a phar file which works for older versions:

```bash
wget https://github.com/mihaeu/php-test-generator/releases/download/1.0.0/test-generator-1.0.0.phar
chmod +x test-generator-1.0.0.phar
```

**Please note that by doing this we should be disgusted at ourselves for not upgrading to PHP 7.1 (soon 7.2).**

### Git

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mihaeu/php-test-generator
cd php-test-generator
composer install
bin/test-generator --help
```

If you don't have PHP 7.1 installed you can run `bin/remove-php7-features` to convert the source files. I won't however except pull requests without PHP 7.1 support.

## Example

Given a PHP file like:

```php
<?php // A.php

class A {
    public function __construct(ClassA $classA) {}
}
```

Running `test-generator A.php` will produce a test including mocked dependencies:

```php
<?php declare(strict_types = 1);

use PHPUnit\Framework\TestCase;

class ATest extends TestCase
{
    /** @var A */
    private $a;

    /** @var ClassA | PHPUnit_Framework_MockObject_MockObject */
    private $classA;

    protected function setUp()
    {
        $this->classA = $this->createMock(ClassA::class);
        $this->a = new A(
            $this->classA
        );
    }

    public function testMissing()
    {
        $this->fail('Test not yet implemented');
    }
}
```
